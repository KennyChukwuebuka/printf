0x11. C - printf
team project done by Chukwuebuka & Nonkululeko

This is a C programming project that implements the printf function. It handles the following conversion specifiers: d, i, u, o, x, X, p, and custom conversion specifiers. It also handles the following flag characters, length modifiers, field width, precision, and the 0 and - flag characters.

Short Introduction

The printf function is a standard C library function that outputs formatted data to stdout. It is one of the most commonly used functions in C programming.

The printf function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. The format string contains text and conversion specifiers. The conversion specifiers tell the printf function how to format the data in the arguments.

The project is divided into two files: printf.c and main.h. The printf.c file contains the implementation of the printf function. The main.h file contains the declaration of the printf function.
